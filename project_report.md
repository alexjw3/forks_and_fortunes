# Project Report: Forks & Fortunes

## Introduction: Does a Fatter Wallet Mean a Better Dinner?

This report tackles a question that has plagued philosophers, economists, and anyone who's ever been hungry in a new neighborhood: does more money mean better food? Specifically, we set out to explore the relationship between the affluence of various Bay Area cities and the state of their restaurant scenes. Our guiding principle was to see if a clear line could be drawn between the price of a mortgage and the quality of a meal. What we found was a story more complex and far more interesting than we'd anticipated.

## Our Not-So-Secret Sauce: The Methodology

To get to the bottom of this, we cooked up a methodology that blends data from a few key sources:

*   **Restaurant Reconnaissance**: We sent the Google Places API on a mission to gather intel on every restaurant it could find. This gave us the goods on everything from star ratings and price levels to how many people had bothered to leave a review.
*   **The Price of a Postcode**: We grabbed property value data from Zillow's Home Value Index (ZHVI). This gave us a solid, if slightly terrifying, look at what it costs to live in these places, which we used as our primary measure of wealth.
*   **The Human Element**: We also pulled in demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau to get a sense of the population and income levels in each city.

## A Look Under the Hood: The Technical Nitty-Gritty

This wasn't just a matter of downloading a few spreadsheets. To get the clean, comprehensive data we needed, we had to build a robust system with a few clever tricks up its sleeve:

*   **Grid-Based Search**: To ensure we didn't miss any hidden gems, we implemented a grid-based search algorithm. Instead of just searching for "restaurants in Palo Alto," we blanketed each city with a grid of overlapping search circles. This guaranteed comprehensive coverage, from the bustling downtown cores to the sleepiest suburban strip malls.
*   **The Quality Quotient**: A simple star rating can be misleading. So, we developed our own composite "quality score." This algorithm takes the base rating and adjusts it based on the number of reviews (a 5-star rating from 1,000 people is more credible than one from the owner's mom) and the price level, giving us a more nuanced measure of a restaurant's true quality. The formula, in essence, is:

    `Quality Score = (Base Rating * Credibility Factor) * Price Adjustment`

    Where the "Credibility Factor" increases with the number of reviews, and the "Price Adjustment" gives a slight boost to mid-range restaurants.
*   **API Wrangling**: When you're making thousands of requests to an API, you have to play nice. Our system has built-in rate limit handling, with intelligent delays and retry logic to avoid getting blacklisted. It's also designed to be resumable; if the process is interrupted, it can pick up right where it left off, saving us from having to re-analyze cities we've already covered.
*   **Data Enrichment and Deduplication**: We enriched the raw data with our custom quality score and then carefully deduplicated the restaurant data based on their unique Google Places ID to ensure that each establishment was only counted once, even if it was picked up in multiple grid searches.

## Visualizing the Data: A Picture is Worth a Thousand Numbers

Sometimes, the best way to understand the data is to see it. We generated a series of visualizations to help illustrate our findings.

## The Data Deep Dive: Surprising, Sensible, and San Franciscan Findings

Our analysis of 18 Bay Area cities served up some juicy findings. Here's a closer look at the numbers:

### The Property Pecking Order
As expected, the Bay Area is home to some of the most expensive real estate in the country. Here are the top 5 cities by median home value:

| Rank | City | Median Home Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Atherton | $7,569,854 |
| 2 | Los Altos | $4,920,665 |
| 3 | Palo Alto | $4,225,558 |
| 4 | Portola Valley | $4,092,075 |
| 5 | Hillsborough | $3,289,325 |

### The Atherton Anomaly: Where the Palates are Pricier
Atherton, the undisputed king of Bay Area property values, presents a fascinating case. With a median home value that looks more like a phone number, you might expect a smorgasbord of Michelin-starred eateries. Instead, we found a surprisingly sparse restaurant landscape. It seems that when your home is a private resort, you're more likely to have a personal chef than a favorite takeout spot. While Atherton's restaurants are, on average, highly rated, there are simply very few of them. This leads to our first major insight: extreme wealth doesn't just buy exclusivity in housing; it creates "restaurant deserts" where the locals are either dining in or dining outâ€”of town.

### The "Sweet Spot" Cities: Quality Without the Quadrillion-Dollar Mortgage
While the wealthiest enclaves might be a bit of a letdown for foodies, we found a "sweet spot" where high-quality dining and (relatively) more accessible property values coexist. Here are the top 5 cities by the percentage of "high-rated" (4.0+ stars) restaurants:

| Rank | City | High-Rated Percentage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | San Francisco | 82.7% |
| 2 | San Mateo | 80.5% |
| 3 | Portola Valley | 79.6% |
| 4 | Daly City | 78.8% |
| 5 | Palo Alto | 77.9% |

Take San Mateo, for example. It boasts one of the highest percentages of top-tier restaurants and a very respectable average quality score, all while having a median home value that, while still eye-watering, is a fraction of Atherton's. These cities seem to have found a happy equilibrium, with a vibrant restaurant scene that caters to a population with discerning tastes but without the isolation that extreme wealth can bring.

### The Great Divide: Restaurant Density vs. Wealth
Our most statistically significant finding was the strong negative correlation (-0.656) between property values and restaurant counts. The more expensive the city, the fewer restaurants it has. This is most starkly illustrated by looking at the cities with the fewest restaurants per billion dollars of *total* property value:

| Rank | City | Restaurants per Billion $ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Menlo Park | 6.85 |
| 2 | Palo Alto | 9.90 |
| 3 | Atherton | 12.12 |
| 4 | Hillsborough | 15.72 |
| 5 | Los Altos | 27.97 |

The city proper of San Francisco, by contrast, is teeming with restaurants, boasting over 150 per billion dollars of property value. This suggests that urban density and a more diverse population are far more important ingredients for a thriving restaurant scene than sheer wealth.

### Price Point Analysis: Where to Find a Fancy Meal (or a Cheap Eat)
Beyond just quality and quantity, we also looked at the price distribution of restaurants. This gives us a sense of the economic character of each city's dining scene. Here are the cities with the highest percentage of "expensive" restaurants:

| Rank | City | Expensive Percentage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Menlo Park | 7.4% |
| 2 | Portola Valley | 7.4% |
| 3 | Palo Alto | 6.7% |
| 4 | San Francisco | 5.8% |
| 5 | Los Altos | 4.4% |

Interestingly, while Atherton is the wealthiest city, it doesn't even crack the top 5 for expensive restaurants, likely due to its small sample size. This further supports the idea that the truly wealthy may not be dining out in their own neighborhoods. On the flip side, cities like South San Francisco and Daly City have a much higher proportion of budget-friendly options, catering to a different demographic.

### Top 5 Cities by Average Restaurant Quality Score

| Rank | City | Average Quality Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | San Francisco | 4.22 |
| 2 | Portola Valley | 4.14 |
| 3 | Daly City | 4.13 |
| 4 | Palo Alto | 4.12 |
| 5 | San Mateo | 4.12 |

### Top 5 Cities by Restaurant Density (per 1k population)

| Rank | City | Restaurants per 1k Population |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Mountain View | 86.11 |
| 2 | San Francisco | 71.78 |
| 3 | Portola Valley | 58.99 |
| 4 | Los Altos | 56.12 |
| 5 | Millbrae | 46.35 |

### Cities with the Most Well-Reviewed Restaurants

| Rank | City | Well-Reviewed Count |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | San Francisco | 2020 |
| 2 | South San Francisco | 1066 |
| 3 | Mountain View | 1055 |
| 4 | San Bruno | 874 |
| 5 | Los Altos | 857 |

### Cities with the Most Budget-Friendly Restaurants

| Rank | City | Budget-Friendly Count |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | San Francisco | 1896 |
| 2 | Daly City | 1649 |
| 3 | South San Francisco | 1071 |
| 4 | Mountain View | 1019 |
| 5 | San Bruno | 852 |

## Limitations and Future Work

No analysis is perfect, and this one is no exception. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

*   **Data Accuracy**: While we've done our best to ensure data quality, we're at the mercy of the APIs we're using. There may be inaccuracies in the restaurant data or the demographic information.
*   **The "Quality" Question**: Our quality score is a good proxy for restaurant quality, but it's not a perfect measure. It doesn't account for things like the specific type of cuisine, the ambiance, or the quality of service.
*   **Correlation vs. Causation**: While we've found some interesting correlations, we can't say for sure that wealth *causes* these differences in the restaurant scene. There are likely many other factors at play.

In the future, we'd love to expand this analysis to include other cities, incorporate more data sources (like Yelp or OpenTable), and even try to build a predictive model to forecast a city's restaurant scene based on its demographics and property values.

## The Final Course: A Few Takeaways

The "Forks & Fortunes" project has shown us that the relationship between money and food is more complex than we might think. It's not a simple case of "more money, more restaurants." Instead, we've seen how extreme wealth can create a kind of culinary isolation, while the most vibrant dining scenes thrive on a mix of density, diversity, and a population that, for whatever reason, would rather not cook tonight.

So, the next time you're looking for a good meal in the Bay Area, you might want to skip the gated communities and head for the bustling city streets. Your walletâ€”and your stomachâ€”will probably thank you.
